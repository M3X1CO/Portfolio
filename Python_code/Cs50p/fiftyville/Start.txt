The RSU keyboards and mice have been stolen from the new IT classroom! The University of Rangsit has called upon you to solve the mystery of the stolen tech. Authorities believe that the thief stole the tech and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. Your goal is to identify:

Who the thief is,
What city the thief escaped to, and
Who the thief’s accomplice is who helped them escape
All you know is that the theft took place on January 28, 2024 and that it took place on Ek Thaksin RD.

How will you go about solving this mystery? The RSU authorities have taken some of the town’s records from around the time of the theft and prepared a SQLite database for you, RSU.db, which contains tables of data from around the town. You can query that table using SQL SELECT queries to access the data of interest to you. Using just the information in the database, your task is to solve the mystery.
